# Next Hacker Jobs

The Next Hacker Jobs" is a web application that allows users to browse the
latest job postings on Hacker News. The application is built using Next.js, a
popular React framework that allows for server-side rendering and easy data
fetching. It features a beautiful "neu brutalist" interface.

Next.js is a powerful framework that offers many advantages, including easy
setup, optimized performance, built-in SEO support, and high customizability
and extensibility. Additionally, the web application uses server-side
rendering, resulting in always up-to-date content and improved SEO.
